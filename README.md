# Project Inventory Application

- An Inventory management app for an imaginary store that includes all of the CRUD methods for both items and categories, so anybody thatâ€™s visits can Create, Read, Update or Delete any Item or Category.

- Using:

  - Express + Typescript
  - Pug + Tailwind
  - Heroku


- Final Notes

  - I found this project to be a great overview of mongoose. It felt a lot more intuitive than using firebase.
  - I think I could improve the data model, i.e. the images data type.
    - This would make completing the additional features easier.
  - I noticed that the MDN local library project that I based my project off used get and post request for everything.
    - I think I need to fix this in the next version:
      - C -> POST
      - R -> GET
      - U -> PUT
      - D -> DELETE

  - Possible Additions:

    - The image uploading feature has not been implemented yet.
    - Updating an item also replaces the current array of items.
    - I might implement multer middleware, but it doesn't match the current schema I have setup.
    - There is an option to pass a link for the thumbnail, but that isn't well implemented as well.
