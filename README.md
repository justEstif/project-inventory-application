# Project Inventory Application

- An Inventory management app for an imaginary store that includes all of the CRUD methods for both items and categories, so anybody thatâ€™s visits can Create, Read, Update or Delete any Item or Category.

- Using:

  - Express + Typescript
  - Pug + Tailwind
  - Heroku

- TODO:

  - The image uploading feature has not been implemented yet.
    - Updating an item also replaces the current array of items.
  - There is an option to pass a link for the thumbnail, but that isn't well implemented as well.
